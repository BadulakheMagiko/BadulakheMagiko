<br /><br />This section is dedicated to a game that I did as a computer science assignment a few years ago. Each one of us had to make a game in Scratch, 
it could be anything we wanted, as long as it was a functional game. 

<br /><br />So I decided to make a fnaf fangame, Trapped at Midnight. In the game you have to survive about 12 hours to escape, there is also a 
hard mode, although it's really just a longer mode. You can play it right here, but if you want to take a look at the code, see 
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/696822688">here</a>. 

<br /><br />It's no big deal, visually it's a bunch of google images compressed by scratch in the worst possible ways and there's not 
even side scrolling in the office; but hey, I had a great time doing it at the time and I'm proud to have done all the code without any 
guidance or reference. <br /><br /><br />

<br /><br />To put something else here, and for the sake of English speakers, I will describe a bit of the game mechanics below:
<br /><br />
- The shadow: It will appear in the orange sector, then to the red sector and from there to either the purple sector or the yellow 
sector (the halls). If you see it very close smiling and then disappear, close the respective door by pressing the button. It is the 
only threat that moves through several cams and I left it at the end for that reason, since programming its behavior seemed to me 
beforehand the most complicated.
<br /><br />
- SCP-173: It is a reverse Golden Freddy, while watching the cameras it will make a sound when entering the office, watch it at that 
moment to make it pop out for a while. 
<br /><br />
- EL_REVISOR: It will appear in the blue sector eventually with the frequency meter in the same camera. You must adjust the frequency 
to the number it asks for, a sound will be emitted when its request changes. This is the puppet of the game, with a camera for this one, 
where you have to attend him every now and then. It's my favorite character of the game, I had it in mind for a project before the game 
and maybe I will use it in the future for something.
<br /><br />
- Pop-ups: Fucking ads. Just click on them or go to the black sector to close them. Each ad works differently, some will cover or remove
 something, others may not close when clicked. I had a lot of fun giving each variant something unique.
<br /><br />
- Biblical Angel: See the vent in front of your office? That's where the angel will try to get to you. Click on the front vent until it is 
completely closed to prevent him from entering, nothing he can tell you is worth the risk. At first I was clear on the mechanics, but I 
didn't know he could get in through there, so I asked a friend in the middle of class and he gave me the idea.
