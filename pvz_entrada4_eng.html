Here we are again, today I am going to talk about the zombies that I have modified both in mechanics and some only in aesthetics.

<br /><br />
First, now the basuc zombies have a little more health and do a little more damage both to plants and when you are hypnotized. At first it was difficult to change the design of the basic zombie, so in the end I opted for a change of colors, going from blue pants and brown jacket to blue jacket and brown pants, it looks surprisingly good, in addition, I also erased the hairs that were left on their heads, making them even more bald.

On the other hand, there would be the conehead, which now wears a dorito on his head, because both are orange and triangular, and also so there is some MLG aesthetics, which never hurts, plus I did that instead of using the standard zombie face, will use the jack-in-the-box zombie, giving it an unhinged look. In terms of gameplay, the cone (or dorito) resists more hits, apart from that, there's not much more to tell.

<br /><br />
If there is more to tell, it would be the buckethead, who is now British for having a phone booth on his head, also because I like how it covers his face completely, thus having a distinction between the 3 variants of the basic zombie. Apart from the fact that the booth resists a few hits less than the cube, is that when you die it will generate a Peashooter zombie behind itself, this is possible thanks to another script.

This last one comes from a mini-game.

And speaking of scripts, there would also be the flag zombie, to which I put a flag of a Minecraft thing that came up when we played it in computer science. Now, apart from announcing the big waves, when it appears it will constantly subtract the suns you have stored, adding some tension at the beginning of each wave and forcing the player to be prepared before it.

<br /><br />
To finish with the zombies of the first scene, there would be the Pole Vaulting, which runs in and after jumping a plant reduces its speed. Now he jumps a second time, jumping from 3 to 5 squares if he runs into a plant (this by means of a script), although now having less life. As for his appearance... Well, it's the result of making him a disguise with goat.png...

It comes out as expected...

<tr> <td width="800" ><font face="Consolas" style="color:ffffff;">
In addition, I changed the sound of the pole for the scream of a goat, to finish the picture, also literally, since this zombie takes its name from the alternate name of Francisco de Goya's <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_aquelarre_(1823)">"El aquelarre"</a>; this is "El Grán Cabrón", being Cabrón both a way to  refeard a goat and an asshole.

<br /><br />
Then, from other scenes there is not much to tell, the screen door zombie now uses the torso of a zombie from the original game as a shield and with less life; and in the cosmos the ducky tube zombie rides a flying saucer, the snorkel zombie is (almost) invisible and the one with a dolphin now has a rocket.

<br /><br />
I have several ideas that I don't know if I will be able to implement, such as a couple of zombies (Yeti, and dolphin rider) that advance ignoring the rest of the plants, or one that bounces projectiles, but until I can make them work I won't show their entries in the almanac, which in the mod is Wikipedia.
