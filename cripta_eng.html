Here is a game I made in 2021 in RPG Maker MV. The premise is simple, you use points to buy characters 
to fight with others to earn more points to buy more characters and items. I made it to tinker a bit and without a clear
 direction beyond collecting characters and farming. <br /><br /><br /><br />

<tr> <td width="800" ><font face="Consolas" style="color:ffffff;">
The game consists of a room in which there are 2 vendors for items and characters along with some sofas to sit and fully heal your team. 
To fight there is the hole in the center of the room for normal fights and the npc with armor allows you to go to bosses and more 
complicated fights.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

The character store actually simply sells items, each one represents a character and when you buy them, a global script is activated that takes the item 
from you and adds the character to your team. I think it has some bugs, but in principle the system works.</td></tr>

<tr> <td width="800" ><font face="Consolas" style="color:ffffff;">
<br /><br />
Finally, the combat is that of your typical rpg maker game. The most relevant thing is that I used a script to be able to switch a character in battle 
with another in reserve (you can only have 4 at a time). Each character has elemental types and up to 4 skills.

I had originally planned to include dungeons of certain themes but ended up losing interest in the game. Here's what I got to 
make of a floating islands dungeon.</td></tr>

It's no big deal, but if you feel like killing some time making Spider-Man fight Freddy Fazbear, you can download the 
game <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/lacriptadelmasallaverso/631956">here</a>, both for pc and android
